Here's your quick TentacleOS App Development Guide! This covers everything you need to know to add apps to the system:

**Key Points:**
- Just create `app1.js`, `app2.js`, etc. files
- Use `TentacleOS.api.registerApp()` to register your app
- Three types: window apps, action apps, and link apps
- Apps automatically appear on desktop and in start menu
- No need to modify the main HTML file

The guide includes:
- Basic templates for each app type
- An interactive counter app example
- How to use TentacleOS utilities and icons
- CSS theming variables
- Testing instructions

You can literally copy any of the example code blocks into an `app1.js` file and it'll work immediately!








export default appConfig;
